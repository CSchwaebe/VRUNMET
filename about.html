												<h2 class="style1">Our Mission</h2>
												<p>People retain what they learn by being engaged and immersed, not by
												redundantly memorizing details out of a textbook. It is one thing to be lying
												on the couch reading a section about emergency codes, but it is an entirely
												different experience to watch an emergency situation unfold right before your
												eyes. With our service, students will be able to directly experience many
												medical situations and surgeries without leaving the comfort of their home.
												Although the field of medicine is growing at an incredible rate, medical
												students are widely limited in gaining clinical experience. We aim to
												eliminate this bottleneck by creating a virtual clinical immersion educational
												course through the use of virtual reality video.</p>

												<h2 class="style1">Market Need</h2>
												<p>Medical school students express the concern that they do not get enough
												immersive clinical experience. This is largely due to impacted programs,
												resource constraints, and logistical obstacles. This results in students
												being limited in the ability to gain hands on experience watching and
												performing procedures. Our solution will allow access to immersive virtual
												clinical experiences to an abundance of students, anytime, and anywhere.
												It will provide the necessary environment for medical students to develop
												medical, surgical, and trauma room skills, improve bedside manners and empathy,
												and advance human anatomy exploration.</p>

											<section>
												<h2 class="style1">Our Solution</h2>
												<p>We are solving the need for immersive clinical experiences by creating
												virtual reality instructional videos. These virtual reality videos will focus 
												on core operations and procedures that medical students need to master. The
												immersive videos allow students to experience medical procedures as if they were
												in the operation room. Our concept currently allows for two ways of viewing the
												surgery: a first person point of view from the doctor’s perspective, and a bird’s
												eye, 3D, 180° view, for high fidelity viewing. These two options will be displayed
												simultaneously, at the option of the user. Students will be able to experience our
												videos with inexpensive consumer hardware.</p>

												<h2 class="style1">Market Potential</h2>
												<p>Virtual reality is a cutting edge way of learning that has a large unexplored
												potential. Our product is entirely scaleable, meaning that once we create the videos,
												we can distribute the intellectual property at little to no cost to us. Moreover,
												market trends of virtual reality glasses positively grew from 2012 to 2018, with 11.29%
												growth rate, which also shows the increasing market potential of related products like
												our videos.</p>

											<section>
												<h2 class="style1">Advantages</h2>
												<p>Most medical training videos do not currently feature the level of immersion
												or fidelity that we offer. When we record in 3D, surgeries come to life, details
												are more crisp, and knowledge retention is significantly higher. With our service,
												students will be able to fully immerse themselves in the program unlike ever before.
												Thus, compared to other learning methods for medical students, such as in-house
												simulations, this fresh and immersive experience of virtual reality will be attractive
												for students to use for learning.</p>

											<section>
												<h2 class="style1">Business Model</h2>
												<p>Our company intends to sell our virtual reality videos to universities and medical
												schools across the country. We will use a combined transactional and subscription
												based revenue model. This means that our customers will either be able to pay a 
												subscription fee for access to our videos, or they will be able to purchase individual
												videos at a more expensive rate. This will incentivize customers to subscribe in order
												to obtain more videos at a cheaper cost, which will serve as a constant revenue model.
												We will have specific videos for different types of procedures, as well as packaged
												“courses” that contain multiple videos surrounding a certain topic. We will be marketing
												all of our videos as an instructional pack or course to medical schools which will be
												able to purchase access to these courses. We plan to primarily target medical schools,
												individual students, and medical interns to begin with, but also expand into targeting
												biomedical engineering programs as we grow.</p>
